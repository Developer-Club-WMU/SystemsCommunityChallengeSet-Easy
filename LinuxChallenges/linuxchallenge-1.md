## Welcome to the World of Linux

The first question you may have is What even is Linux and why is it so important everywhere. Funfact most of the worlds IT infrastructure and Handhelds and Gaming Consoles run some sort of Linux at its core, from supercomputers and quantum computers to your daily use Phones to your Smart Home Controls and much more.

Linux at its core is an Operating System just like Windows or Mac OS. Unlike the popular belief, you don't need to know everything about commandline to operate Linux, in-fact most of the mainstream distributions don't even require terminal unless you are messing around very deep and even have safeguards in place.

Linux or rather GNU/Linux by nature is a Free and Open Source Operating System which means it is not only Free to use, you can checkout its source code at kernel.org, modify the kernel to your hearts content and even contribute to it in meaningful ways when you are ready to dedicate time to some open source project. Linux is maintained by Linux Foundation and primarily by Linus Torvald.

Anyway we are not here to discuss about History are we, (we can but do we really want to?) Lets get more into the command line. You dont even need to learn programming in order to get into the world of linux! You can get started by spinning up your own VM, Install Ubuntu on it or alternatively if your system doesnt behave well with VMs, you also have the option to try out Ubuntu Workstation Resources we have setup, time for which can be requested by using the following link:

## Getting Started with Terminal

If you have installed Ubuntu or are using one of the Linux Workstations, you are already on Ubuntu. If not there are multitude of online resources from official forums to wikis and more to help you out with the distro. Due to the sheer vast nature of Linux Distros and the respective Ecosystems we can't expect to cover every single distribution so we will be primarily recommending and using Ubuntu as the base distro. Feel free to try and experiment with new distros.

### Checkout this awesome page where you can tryout various distros online for limited time.

## The Terminal!

### Ubuntu primarily uses a customized version of the Gnome Desktop although it comes with other flavours which we wont exactly be going into here. The navigation will not exactly be like what you are used to on Windows and Mac. 

Pressing the Windows Key (on Windows) or Command Key (on Mac) will open up the apps menu, from there you can use the mouse scrollwheel or touchpad gestures or your gamepad controlls or whatever pointing device you have to find the application called Terminal. OR you can simply use the search menu and open that application.
